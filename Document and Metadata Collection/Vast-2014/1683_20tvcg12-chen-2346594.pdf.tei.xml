Abstract—Scatterplots are widely used to visualize scatter dataset for exploring outliers, clusters, local trends, and correlations. Depicting multi-class scattered points within a single scatterplot view, however, may suffer from heavy overdraw, making it inefficient for data analysis. This paper presents a new visual abstraction scheme that employs a hierarchical multi-class sampling technique to show a feature-preserving simplification. To enhance the density contrast, the colors of multiple classes are optimized by taking the multi-class point distributions into account. We design a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative analysis from different perspectives. We have applied our system to several challenging datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As one of the most fundamental visual representations, scatterplots use 2D Cartesian coordinates to depict a set of bivariate points. The point collection in a 2D plane can be explored and analyzed to study point distributions <ref type="bibr" coords="1,356.28,616.64,14.24,8.12" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,373.32,616.64,10.59,8.12" target="#b41"> 42]</ref>, clusters <ref type="bibr" coords="1,420.61,616.64,14.24,8.12" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.65,616.64,10.59,8.12" target="#b46"> 47]</ref>, outliers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,484.44,616.64,13.70,8.12" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, local trends <ref type="bibr" coords="1,549.48,616.64,9.69,8.12" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,308.76,626.60,6.54,8.12" target="#b8"> 9]</ref>, and axial correlations <ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.23,626.60,13.78,8.12" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. One challenging problem for visualizing scatterplots is the overdraw (see <ref type="figure" coords="1,347.29,646.64,30.88,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a)) caused by a dense point distribution. In the past decade, many research efforts have concentrated on reduction of overdraw and its effects. In general, one can modulate the limited visual channels of points, e.g., the point size <ref type="bibr" coords="1,462.35,676.52,14.14,8.12" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,478.69,676.52,11.99,8.12" target="#b30"> 31] </ref>or the opacity <ref type="bibr" coords="1,544.32,676.52,14.87,8.12" target="#b17">[18] </ref> to decrease the overplotting degree. Alternatively, the density estima- tion <ref type="bibr" coords="1,324.85,696.45,9.81,8.12" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,336.74,696.45,6.68,8.12" target="#b2"> 3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,345.62,696.45,11.99,8.12" target="#b17"> 18] </ref>can be employed to reformulate the point distribution in a simple form. This is effective for clarifying dense regions, but can hardly show outliers which typically lie in low density regions. Spatially moving the overplotted points to unoccupied pixels <ref type="bibr" coords="1,521.18,726.33,14.25,8.12" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,538.34,726.33,11.99,8.12" target="#b25"> 26] </ref>is another way to address the overdraw problem. However, it is not able for quantitative analysis because point distribution is changed. The point overdraw problem is further exaggerated when multiclass points are shown in a single scatterplot <ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.64,73.27,13.70,8.12" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. To alleviate this problem, the continuous density fields with respect to each class of points can be reconstructed. Then the commonly used multi-variate data visualization methods such as contouring, color blending <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.93,103.16,13.82,8.12" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and color weaving <ref type="bibr" coords="2,122.52,113.12,14.25,8.12" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.45,113.12,11.99,8.12" target="#b21"> 22] </ref> are utilized. Nevertheless, these methods may yield misleading representations, especially in regions where multiple classes exist. In addition, the relative density orders among classes cannot be preserved well for quantitative analysis (see <ref type="figure" coords="2,273.37,143.01,29.80,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) and <ref type="figure" coords="2,82.57,152.97,31.13,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(c)). This greatly hinders the abilities of users for identifying outliers, discriminating dense regions, analyzing correlations , and comparing patterns. Our work is motivated by an artistic map design that illustrates a territorial multi-class statistical dataset. Conventionally, a filled color map is employed to visualize such kinds of datasets, but it will lead to information loss. Take the Chicago ethnic distribution map as an example (see the bottom left in <ref type="figure" coords="2,157.45,222.70,28.84,8.12" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), the relative population density and transitions among races are missing in each region (e.g., the one indicated by the black arrow). In contrast, Bill Rankin <ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.86,242.62,14.87,8.12" target="#b34">[35] </ref>proposed a dot map technique, with which the racial distributions in a region are directly represented by the density of multiple sets of colored dots. The dot color represents the race and the density encodes the size of the population. Generally, this representation is endowed with several merits: 1) no new colors are synthesized; 2) relative features are preserved locally. Essentially, the dot map technique employs a point sampling scheme to approximate the distributions of multiple variates. Compared with the uniformly filled color map, it greatly improves the readability of the visualization result in terms of showing multi-variate distributions and correlations. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,150.47,635.01,13.26,7.64" target="#b34">[35] </ref>of Chicago 2010 with the dot mapping representation motivates our work. For a high resolution version, please refer to the project website (http://www.radicalcartography.net). </p><p> Inspired by this dot map design, this paper proposes a feature preserving reformulation to reduce the visual clutter of multi-class scatterplots . The kernel is a reconstruction-and-resampling process that generates a visual abstraction of the input point distribution. To make it amenable for multi-class points, a multi-class blue noise based sampling scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="2,102.83,726.32,14.99,8.12" target="#b40">[41] </ref>is employed. We also propose a color optimization technique to enhance the perceptual contrast in multi-class regions. </p><p> The integrated visual exploration system consists of a suite of distribution study, and focus+context interaction toolkits to support visual inspection and quantitative analysis of multi-class points. In summary, this paper presents a complementary means to conventional scatterplot visualization techniques with the following contribu- tions: @BULLET A hierarchical multi-class sampling scheme that reduces the overdraw and preserves the point distributions for quantitative analysis. @BULLET A visual exploration system for interactive inspection and analysis of multi-class points. </p><p> The remaining parts are organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work. Our approach is described in Section 3. A visual exploration system is presented in Section 4. The evaluation of our approach and some directions for future work are discussed in Section 5 and Section 6. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 7. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Visualizing a set of points with different attributes in a 2D plane is a fundamental task. Various schemes have been proposed to enhance the visual perception. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Overdraw Reduction for Scatterplots</head><p>One critical issue for displaying a large amount of points in a 2D plane is the overdraw problem. Conventional solutions can be roughly categorized into three classes. Changing the visual channels are a simple and intuitive way to deal with the overdraw issue. Woodruff et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.23,347.48,15.00,8.12" target="#b43">[44] </ref> chose to visualize scatter dataset with small-size dots in highly dense regions and large-size icons in sparse regions for outliers, as small dots occupy relatively less screen space. A similar scheme was exploited by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,334.32,387.33,14.85,8.12" target="#b10">[11] </ref> to explore the resulting projection for DTI fibers. The Utopi- an <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.76,397.29,14.86,8.12" target="#b11">[12] </ref>system generated an alpha blended scatterplot for interactive topic modeling. Dang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,420.35,407.25,15.00,8.12" target="#b15">[16] </ref> proposed a method to handle overplotting issue by stacking points in the third dimension. Luboschik et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.40,427.18,14.98,8.12" target="#b31">[32] </ref>introduced the aligned weaving technique that can improve the representation of overlapping clusters in scatterplots. Generally these methods are effective, but the number of usable visual channels are quite limited. Our method is compatible with these techniques and can further alleviate the overdraw issue. Density estimation provides an alternative solution to avoid overdraw for visualizing large scatter datasets. The density can be simply measured by dividing the drawing space into bins and counting the number of data points falling into them. Alpha blended scatterplots are an example of this technique. This simple discrete form of density is prone to introduce bias in visualization. Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,535.56,527.15,10.43,8.12" target="#b6">[7] </ref>used hexagonal cells to accumulate densities. Bachthaler et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,528.13,537.12,9.68,8.12" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,540.61,537.12,7.42,8.12" target="#b2"> 3] </ref>proposed a rigorous, accurate, and generic mathematical model to create the continuous scatterplots. Zinsmaier et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,481.46,557.04,14.98,8.12" target="#b47">[48] </ref> employed the kernel density estimation (KDE) to visualize overlapped nodes and edges in large graphs. The density estimation can also be adopted to visualize overlapped trajectories <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.56,586.92,14.21,8.12" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,436.33,586.92,10.68,8.12" target="#b42"> 43]</ref>. Color mapping and contouring are two common methods to visualize and highlight dense regions in a reconstructed continuous density field. Unfortunately, these methods neglect the outliers in the resulting visualization, as outliers create small regions of low density in the continuous density field. Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.02,636.73,14.99,8.12" target="#b17">[18] </ref> suggested mean emphasis in kernel density estimation to reveal real outliers. Mayorga and Gleicher <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.53,646.69,14.83,8.12" target="#b32">[33] </ref>proposed to explicitly display outliers coupled with color mapping and contouring. Nevertheless , simultaneously encoding and visualizing multiple density fields are quite difficult for multi-class scatterplots. Multi-variate data visualization methods such as color blending and color weaving can be employed to visualize multiple density fields with limitations as well. The color blending methods may synthesize new colors. The color weaving methods cannot show relative density features among classes. Our method exploits the density information as constraints to resample the input data points. It does not bring new colors and also enables users to study relative density features through the number of non-overlapped samples. Spatial distortion can also be used to eliminate the overdraw problem . Keim and Herrmann <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.46,83.35,14.97,8.12" target="#b25">[26] </ref>introduced the Gridfit algorithm to avoid overplotting when visualizing large amounts of spatial reference data points. Its key idea is to place the overplotted data points on the nearest unoccupied pixels and shift data points along a screen-filling curve. Later, Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,144.15,123.20,14.84,8.12" target="#b24">[25] </ref>developed a more flexible technique called the generalized scatterplot, which allows users to strike a balance between overplotting and distortion. Janetzko et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,263.21,143.12,14.95,8.12" target="#b23">[24] </ref>proposed to enhance the scatterplots using the ellipsoid pixel placement scheme. Further, Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,145.35,163.05,14.85,8.12" target="#b44">[45] </ref>presented a warping method to avoid important features overplotted during resizing. In essence, distortion based methods change the underlying topology and distribution of the dataset, which may cause misleading perceptions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Interactive Exploration and Analysis for Scatterplots</head><p>A bunch of navigation tools and scatterplot variants were developed to assist users discovering and exploring the insights from datasets. Buering et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,100.82,244.30,10.54,8.12" target="#b4">[5] </ref>proposed two interaction techniques to explore a large dataset in a small screen: a geometric-semantic zoom that provides a smooth transition between overview and detail, and a fisheye distortion that displays the focus and context regions of the scatterplot in a single view. Elmqvist et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,159.13,284.15,14.86,8.12" target="#b16">[17] </ref> exploited animated transitions between scatterplots for visual exploration of a multidimensional dataset. Yuan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,87.62,304.07,14.85,8.12" target="#b46">[47] </ref> presented a comprehensive tool equipped with selection , zooming, dragging, and linking for interactive subspace exploration of 2D scatterplots. Collins et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,189.13,323.99,14.99,8.12" target="#b12">[13] </ref>enhanced the set relation of points on the plot with clustering and contours.

Leland et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,58.23,363.84,14.12,8.12" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,75.62,363.84,11.99,8.12" target="#b41"> 42] </ref>defined a set of measures to characterize the scatterplot point distributions and used these measures to organize scatterplots for high-dimensional data analysis. Radloff et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,224.76,383.76,14.88,8.12" target="#b33">[34] </ref>used additional visual encodings to represent dots in scatterplots on heterogenous displays . In this work, we provide a complementary means to improve the readability of multi-class scatterplots. We also show how existing analysis methods and interactions such as brushing and focus+context can further enhance users' understanding in meaningful ways. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Noise for Visualization</head><p>Noise has been widely used in various visualization techniques.

Spot noise <ref type="bibr" coords="3,88.22,484.94,14.87,8.12" target="#b39">[40] </ref>was introduced to vector field visualization by Jark van Wijk. Inspired by this method, a white noise texture was employed by line integral convolution (LIC) based methods <ref type="bibr" coords="3,251.77,504.86,13.70,8.12" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . Khlebnikov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,90.86,514.83,14.86,8.12" target="#b27">[28] </ref>investigated the possibility of using Gabor noise to visualize 2D multivariate dataset. Later they extended this method to multivariate volume data visualization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,189.01,534.75,13.80,8.12" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A perceptually adapted Perlin Noise was employed by Coninx et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,211.45,544.83,14.87,8.12" target="#b13">[14] </ref> to visualize uncertain scalar field. Bertini and Santucci <ref type="bibr" coords="3,191.57,554.79,10.40,8.12" target="#b3">[4] </ref>presented a random data sampling method to model the underlying data density for scatterplot quality enhancement. Unfortunately it is intractable for multi-class scatter datasets. Our work leverages the multi-class blue noise sampling method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,75.02,594.64,15.00,8.12" target="#b40">[41] </ref> to abstract the overlapped multi-class data points while preserving features such as relative density orders among classes. One of its main advantages is that the blue noise feature is guaranteed for each individual class and the union of all classes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VISUAL ABSTRACTION OF MULTI-CLASS SCATTERPLOTS</head><p>Overdraw is caused by the conflict between the limited screen space and the large number of points. In some cases, it is inevitable, and prevents users from insightful data observations. To address this issue, we employ a visual abstraction scheme that estimates the point density of each class and resamples the estimated density fields. The main concept behind our approach is to use a cloud of sampled points to mimic the intrinsic multi-class point distributions. Rather than using a conventional point sampling (e.g., blue noise) for each class, a multi-class blue noise sampling scheme is employed for multiple point classes. Please refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="3,365.30,53.36,14.85,8.12" target="#b40">[41] </ref>for the differences between the single-class and multi-class blue noise sampling techniques. Showing points generated with the multi-class blue noise is straightforward . To clearly differentiate data classes, we optimize the color set by maximizing the distinguishability in multi-class regions. Additionally , different types of point shape such as ellipse and dot-line are employed to show the local trends. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Point Density Estimation</head><p> Density estimation is a common way to handle large datasets. It creates a continuous density scalar field from the given data points. KDE is a well-studied statistical tool for this purpose. Let X i = {x 1 i , x 2 i , ..., x m i } be the data points of the i-th data class. Mathematically, the density at location x is computed by: </p><formula>ˆ f i (x) = m ∑ j=1 K h (x − x j i ), </formula><formula>(1) </formula><p>where K h (·) is a kernel function with bandwidth h which determines the smoothing degree of the reconstructed density field. Different from the conventional KDE method, we do not use the number of data points to normalize the density for the purpose of directly comparing densities at location x. A Gaussian kernel is used in our approach with the bandwidth h determined by the Silverman's rule of thumb <ref type="bibr" coords="3,531.82,284.60,15.00,8.12" target="#b37">[38] </ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Feature-preserving Point Resampling</head><p> Point sampling is a fundamental tool to reduce the number of data points while best preserving the features for many computational tasks. Due to the uniformity and absence of spectral bias <ref type="bibr" coords="3,527.38,334.76,13.81,8.12" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the blue noise sampling technique has been favored in many applications such as image stippling <ref type="bibr" coords="3,395.03,354.68,14.12,8.12" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,411.47,354.68,11.86,8.12" target="#b45"> 46] </ref>and point cloud resampling <ref type="bibr" coords="3,525.70,354.68,13.81,8.12" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Individually sampling each data class cannot guarantee that the blue noise features are preserved for the union of all data classes. Therefore, we employ the adaptive multi-class blue noise sampling method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,338.52,394.53,14.99,8.12" target="#b40">[41] </ref> that uses a dart throwing technique to reproduce the input data distributions. During the sample generation process, an n × n symmetric matrix R x at the trial location x is built for conflict check. n is the number of data classes. R x generalizes the distance constraint in the Poisson disk sampling for a single class. The element R x i, j specifies the distance constraint between the i-th and the j-th data class at the location x (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,378.25,455.71,30.76,8.12">Figure 3</ref>as an illustration). We use the estimated density to compute the distance constraint matrix R x . Specifically, the diagonal elements of R x i,i are defined as ω/ ˆ f i (x), and all non-diagonal elements are computed according to the suggestion by Wei <ref type="bibr" coords="3,523.43,486.91,13.81,8.12" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. ω is a user adjustable parameter. 1/ω can be treated as the frequency for sampling. In our system, users can change this parameter to control the number of points shown in the view. <ref type="figure" coords="3,308.77,621.33,19.29,7.64">Fig. 3</ref> . To position a sample of Class1 (i.e., the solid blue dot) at location x, the distance constraint matrix R x is computed first. Its diagonal elements R x i,i constrain the intra-class distances, and its non-diagonal elements R x i, j restrict the inter-class distances. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>= </head><formula>3.0 Class1 Class2 Class3 R x R x i,i R x i, j x </formula><p> By default, ω is computed by means of a heuristic rule in our exploration system. For 2D scatterplots, the orthogonal projection scheme is employed to render data points. Let ϕ be the zooming scale for rendering points, and r be the point radius. The sampling frequency parameter is approximated by: </p><formula>ω = r ϕ ¯ f (2) </formula><p>where ¯ f represents the mean density of all data classes over the do- main. A simple way for resampling is to sample the reconstructed continuous density field generated by the KDE technique. However, new data points may be produced (see the green points in the region indicated by the orange ellipse in <ref type="figure" coords="4,138.71,103.16,30.17,8.12" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>(b)), which is not preferable. In our approach, the resampling process is performed in a discrete sampling space constituted by all input multi-class data points. To ensure that each class is well sampled, a new trial sample is always randomly selected from the class that is currently most under-filled (Please refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="4,109.44,152.97,14.98,8.12" target="#b40">[41] </ref>for the details on the fill rate computation). If the trial sample passes the conflict check, it will be inserted to the output data point list. Otherwise it will be discarded. <ref type="figure" coords="4,224.39,172.89,30.65,8.12" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>compares an input scatterplot, the one by sampling the estimated point density field, and the one sampled in the discrete space. </p><formula>(a) (b) (c) (d) </formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Consistency-preserving Hierarchical Sampling</head><p>Zooming operations are a commonly used interaction to study a dataset. If using the current zooming scale ϕ to resample the input data points, it might lose consistency (notice the differences in regions indicated by the orange circles at the top row in <ref type="figure" coords="4,234.70,526.87,29.88,8.12">Figure 5</ref>). Ideally, more points should be added to the view when the view is zoomed in and some points should be removed when the view is zoomed out. To achieve a smooth zooming, we employ a hierarchical sampling scheme that pre-computes a sequence of coarse-to-fine sampling points. Specifically, we start sampling with an initial small ϕ which corresponds to the coarsest level. Empirically, ϕ is set to make all data points are shown in a small region of the entire viewport (in practice , we set it to be 1/8). For each subsequent level, the pre-computed samples are used as partial samples for next runs of sampling. Finally , the output samples record the points that are approximately sorted by zooming levels in an ascending order. Algorithm 1 presents the pseudocode. The run-time visualization is performed by showing all points with the generated zooming levels that are smaller than the current level. Smooth transitions are supported between different zooming levels. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Abstractive Visualization</head><p>Resampling multi-class points generates a sequence of non-overlapped points.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Point Color</head><p>A recent work <ref type="bibr" coords="4,371.05,563.23,14.97,8.12" target="#b18">[19] </ref> suggests that color outperforms shape for multiclass scatterplots in many comparative tasks. Even when the number of points increases, the performance remains good. However, using color to distinguish different classes is not a trivial task. In order to clearly identify different classes, the color distinguishability in overlapped regions needs to be as significant as possible. We offer two methods for users to select colors, namely, a friendly hue wheel based color picking interface and an automatic color selection approach. In the hue wheel based color picking interfaces, users are allowed to freely select a set of colors to label individual data classes. To help users in selecting distinguishable colors for different classes , we also provide an automatic color selection approach, in which an optimal color set is selected automatically. More specifically, we employ a color optimization algorithm, which takes the density information into account. Suppose that the scatterplot is rendered on a rectangular screen area, which is further divided into M local regions (e.g. 5 × 5 pixels for a local region). Our automatic color selection approach seeks to find a color set C = {C 1 ,C 2 , ...,C n } in the CIELAB color space so that the visualization has a maximal color distinguishability. C i denotes the color for the i-th data class. We maximize the following objective function to obtain an optimal color set: </p><formula>E cost = M ∑ m=1 β m ∑ i, j&lt;n,i&lt; j α m,i, j |C i −C j |, </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p>where α m,i, j denotes the inter-class weight, which measures the weight of the color distinguishability between the i-th and j-th class in the mth local region. Meanwhile, β m denotes the intra-class weight, which measures the weight of the m-th local region in the entire screen area. The item |C i −C j | denotes the color distinguishability between C i and C j . It is computed by the Euclidean distance in the CIELAB color space, which is perceptually uniform. In our implementation, the weights α i, j and β for the m-th local region are defined as </p><formula>α i, j = e −| ¯ f i − ¯ f j | , β = n ∑ i=0 ¯ f i . </formula><formula>(4) </formula><p>To prevent the optimization from reaching an unsatisfying result, we add a further constraint that colors are at least apart from each other at distance d in a perceptually uniform color space. Following a soft constraint implementation, it yields a minimization problem: </p><formula>min −E cost + k ∑ i, j&lt;n,i&lt; j E penalty (C i ,C j ), </formula><formula>(5) </formula><p>where k is an adjustable weight, and </p><formula>E penalty (C i ,C j ) = max(0, 1 − |C i −C j | d ). </formula><p>We choose the CIELAB color model, in which the L* channel denotes the perceptually perceived lightness. Instead of optimizing within the entire color space, we intend to seek iso-lightness colors for different classes by leaving L* as a user adjustable parameter. Thereby, the optimization process minimize Equation (5) by search other two channels (i.e. a* and b*) in an isolightness plane within the gamut of the CIELAB color space. We apply the Nelder and Mead method <ref type="bibr" coords="5,154.33,446.24,14.84,8.12" target="#b28">[29] </ref>to find an optimal solution. As the downhill simplex method works iteratively and is prone to converge to a local minima, we run the optimization method several times with random initializations and keep the best solution finally. </p></div>

Each user has 17 attributes including the encrypted phone number, the package type, the total-call-charge, the total-talktime , and so on. Two types of records are removed in our data cleaning process: @BULLET Data records with missing attributes; @BULLET Data records with illegal values, e.g. a record with a negative total-call-charge. 245,309 records are used after cleaning. After a quick look at the total-talk-time and the total-call-charge, we can find a strong linear relationship between them (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,153.13,506.62,34.61,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(a)). We use the package type to label each user. The derived scatterplot is a multi-class scatterplot. We first employ the Splatterplots <ref type="bibr" coords="7,179.54,526.90,14.87,8.12" target="#b32">[33] </ref> by color blending and contouring the reconstructed density fields to study the density distributions .

In the overlapped dense regions, new colors are synthesized. The color weaving method can avoid this problem, and can help users identify classes in the overlapped dense regions (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,63.04,596.64,34.60,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(c)). The limitation of both methods is that the relative density orders among different classes are missing. <ref type="figure" coords="7,56.20,616.80,35.32,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(d) presents the result of our method using the circular dot representation. The relative density orders in a local region can be perceived by the number of visible dots. For example, users with Package Type 3 dominate the lower left part in this view. We can also find that users with Package Type 2 and Package Type 4 are the dominant classes in the highlighted rectangle (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,244.45,666.61,35.10,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(f)), because more cyan and orange points are displayed in this region. In addition, different types of correlations are clearly shown in our result with a dot-line representation (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,173.31,696.50,35.09,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(e)). The local trend of each point in Package Type 3 and 5 roughly follows the 45 degree diagonal line (Please zoom in or refer to the supplementary images for details). This may indicate that Package Type 3 and 5 do not contain a restriction on the minimum charge. In contrast, Package Type 1, Package Type 2, and Package Type 4 do not exhibit such property, and the local trends are almost parallel to the dimension of total-talktime . This may imply that each package type (1,2, and 4) has a varied restriction on the minimum charge. </p></div>

A participant could achieve a maximum score of 4 for each scheme. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,308.79,686.57,16.43,8.05">[T2] </ref>Relative densities recognition In this task, each participant had to choose an answer that could best describe the relative density orders in the marked region. 16 different datasets were used in this task. Each participant had to finish 16 questions . Similar to T1, the datasets were first randomly permuted for a participant. The same scoring strategy was used for this task. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure </head><p>Before the formal study, we spent about 12 minutes to briefly train the participants, including getting their informed consent, completing a general questionnaire, and explaining tasks. After the two tasks were finished, a post study questionnaire were given to record their general comments about the techniques and the entire user study. <ref type="figure" coords="8,315.36,696.43,34.24,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>shows the overall performances on task T1 and T2. It is easy to see that our method significantly outperforms other threes schemes especially in terms of relative density order recognition. By analyzing the incorrect answers for C, CB, and CW in the task T2, we find that the answer Hard to determine were selected 37 and 31 times for CB and CW respectively. However, only 8 questions for C were answered with the Hard to determine option. This is because the color blending and weaving methods cannot preserve relative density features. They can hardly be employed for quantitative tasks. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p> The orders in which the points are drawn greatly influence the visualization results for conventional multi-class scatterplots. <ref type="figure" coords="9,261.00,492.55,35.57,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>shows two visualizations with different orders of a dataset by Tableau (http://www.tableausoftware.com/). To study the patterns in a multiclass dataset with conventional scatterplots, users have to manually exchange the drawn orders. In contrast, our approach is orderindependent and yields an occlusion-free result. Due to the limitations of the human visual perceptual system, the distance from the eye to the display also has influences on the comprehension of resulting visualizations. Points tend to be blended when users stay far away from the display. A possible solution would be to adaptively modulate the point radii. In practice, we can use depth cameras or eye tracking equipments to measure the eye-screen distance. At a coarse zooming level, our method with the default sampling frequency parameter might generate relatively less points in medium and low density regions. To study features such as shapes or clusters of points in these regions, gradually increasing the sampling frequency or interactively zooming the view are two feasible solutions. Although our approach aims at abstracting the multi-class scatterplots in a single view, it can be extended to visualize multi-variate datasets by employing the scatterplot matrix representation. We see many directions for future work. 1) While the current sampling scheme cannot exactly preserve the ratios among classes, we intend to employ a soft disk sampling technique <ref type="bibr" coords="9,485.04,154.76,13.81,8.12" target="#b40">[41]</ref> . With this technique , a fixed number of samples in each class will be produced in a local region such that the relative ratios are preserved. 2) Our method scales well in the number of data points. Using colors to identify different classes limits the the number of data classes shown in a single view. We intend to find the capacity limit of class number in different situations. 3) To assist users identifying classes, our current solution only considers the color distinguishability. We intend to take other perceptual factors such as visual importance and attentions into account. 4) Compared with the ellipse representation, the dot-line representation has the capability to show global trends. However it might obscure the relative density features and introduce visual clutter due to the extra line geometries. We expect to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual representations to encode local trends in scatterplots. 5) We also would like to study the density variations in different regions after applying our approach. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presents a preliminary work that employs an alternative method for multi-class scatter data visualization. While previous works leverage opacity, color, and other visual channels to eliminate the overdraw problem, ours utilizes spatial redistribution. The core is a hierarchical multi-class blue noise sampling scheme. As a key benefit, our method generates a visual abstraction of the input point distributions while the overdraw is alleviated. To help users identify different data classes, a color optimization technique is employed. Both case studies and the user study have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. The visual exploration system equipped with a set of interaction tools enables users to study a multi-class scatter dataset from different perspectives. </p></div>
