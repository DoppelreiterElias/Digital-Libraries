For example, most of these techniques attach great importance to the analysis models, while lacking interactive processes and the capability of intuitively analyzing big meteorological data. Individual changes hidden in such statisticsoriented processes are often ignored, when analyzing the overall changes. Furthermore, because a large number of climate problems have no reliable " ground truth " data, it is crucial to develop objective evaluation methods for comparing the outcomes of different analysis techniques. We thus resort to visualization techniques, and attempt to design a visualization framework that can intuitively and interactively reveal the evolutionary nature of climate change patterns at different spatiotemporal scales. We aim at addressing the following requirements <ref type="bibr" coords="2,135.15,239.66,9.52,9.96">[3]</ref>. First, climate represents the long-term average meteorological status in given regions, to evaluate climate changes, statistical analyses based on decades or longer observation data are necessary. Second, climate is inherently associated with geoinformation , so the visualization granularities between temporal and spatial dimensions must be balanced and easily tuned. Finally, apart from macro and global climate change phenomena, users, such as climate researchers and policy makers, may also be interested in local and micro (e.g. abnormal) conditions. Our goal is to identify climate change patterns through visual analysis based on in-site climate observation station data which are also essential for traditional quantitative methods. The proposed visualization framework for climate changes, which we will call Vismate, contains three visualization modules, i.e. Global Radial Map, Time Series Discs and Anomalies Detection Scatterplot. To evaluate our approach, we used Vismate to analyze China Surface Data for International Exchange and Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,119.63,409.64,15.00,9.96" target="#b15">[25] </ref>data, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="2,217.99,409.64,43.04,9.96">Fig. 1 and</ref><ref type="figure" coords="2,266.62,409.64,28.90,9.96">Fig. 12</ref>respectively. By consulting domain experts and checking against the related literature, all the patterns discovered in our case studies have been confirmed, thus proving the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach. The major contributions of this paper include: @BULLET Visimate, a visual analytical framework for discovering climate change patterns at different spatiotemporal scales. @BULLET Three complementary visualization techniques for spatial and temporal patterns in a single view, time-series patterns, and anomaly detection. </p><p>@BULLET Discovery of several temperature patterns of China and the world relating to the climate changes. </p><p>The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. The approach overview is then described in Section 3, followed by three complementary visualization techniques in Section 4, 5, and 6 respectively. Section 7 describes two analytical case studies and an expert review. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 8. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Spatial and Temporal Visualization</head><p>Thematic map <ref type="bibr" coords="2,102.04,659.66,14.95,9.96" target="#b31">[41] </ref> is perhaps the most traditional method of georelated data visualization, which can be viewed as an overlay of heatmap or glyphs on a map. A novel type of quantitative thematic map was introduced by Speckman et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.69,689.66,13.75,9.96" target="#b33">[43]</ref>, i.e. Necklace Maps. Taggram <ref type="bibr" coords="2,81.03,699.68,14.99,9.96" target="#b19">[29] </ref>is another type of thematic map, in which tag clouds <ref type="bibr" coords="2,45.36,709.64,14.98,9.96" target="#b16">[26] </ref>were plotted on a map to represent the area characteristics. These methods work well for representing static data, but provide limited supports for visualizing time-oriented geographic data. Many researchers attempted to tackle this problem by jointly using a map and other time-series visualization techniques. Malik et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,543.08,59.66,14.94,9.96" target="#b17">[27] </ref>comprehensively used the map, bar chart, line chart and pie chart to analyze the correlation between urban crime activities and spatiotemporal dimensions. Landesberger et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.13,89.66,14.93,9.96" target="#b14">[24] </ref>designed a dynamic categorical data view (DCDV) to visualize human position transitions in one day, and associated it with a geography view. Furthermore, parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.46,119.66,14.26,9.96" target="#b10">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.41,119.66,10.65,9.96" target="#b37"> 47]</ref>, ThemeRiver <ref type="bibr" coords="2,524.97,119.66,14.19,9.96" target="#b6">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,543.86,119.66,10.59,9.96" target="#b7"> 17]</ref>, stacked bar charts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,392.57,129.68,13.78,9.96" target="#b20">[30]</ref>, and even all existing time-series visualization techniques can be combined with a map to form effective spatiotemporal data visualization tools. However, these loosely coupled spatiotemporal visualization methods do not provide an overview of spatial and temporal dimensions, and lack of intuitive and compact methods for visualizing spatiotemporal data in a single view. Different from such multi-view methods, our approach offers a global yet compact view, integrating both the spatial and the temporal features. Radial visualization, or displaying data in a circular or elliptical layout, is an increasingly common technique in information visualization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.56,239.66,9.51,9.96">[6]</ref>, which often encode time dimension by several concentric rings <ref type="bibr" coords="2,369.49,249.68,9.76,9.96">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,382.39,249.68,10.65,9.96" target="#b40"> 50]</ref>. However, we often ignore its advantage of representing orientation and position due to its non-directional shape. For example, Qu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,403.85,269.66,14.99,9.96" target="#b24">[34] </ref>designed an s-shaped axis used in parallel coordinates to represent the wind direction, and Malik et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,307.80,289.64,15.01,9.96" target="#b18">[28] </ref>used multiple regular polygons for the comparative visualization. To improve the effectiveness and gain enough space for extra visualization components, one often utilizes the inside and outside of the radial visualizations. For example, Draper et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,505.86,319.64,10.52,9.96">[7] </ref>put search conditions in the central space, while Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.98,329.66,15.02,9.96" target="#b40">[50] </ref>utilized inside space to place a triangular ScatterPlot. A human body chart was laid in radar plot by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.48,349.64,14.99,9.96" target="#b44">[54] </ref>to visualize a person's health condition, and Burch <ref type="bibr" coords="2,399.10,359.66,10.50,9.96">[2] </ref>drew many thumbnails outside the outermost ring of the TimeRadar. Inspired by these methods, the main visualization in our framework has also a radial layout. We encode time dimension by different concentric rings along radial direction with a map in the center, so that our approach can visualize spatial and temporal dimension at the same time. Moreover, the outside area of the radial plot is utilized to represent clustered information that is very essential for climate studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Climate Data Visualization</head><p>Visualization has been an effective tool in climate studies, and there are many classic visualization methods, such as contour line <ref type="bibr" coords="2,540.83,471.68,13.71,9.96" target="#b39">[49]</ref>, standard coloration <ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.64,481.64,13.75,9.96" target="#b31">[41]</ref>, rose diagram <ref type="bibr" coords="2,451.16,481.64,13.78,9.96" target="#b11">[21]</ref>, etc.. These methods are usually simple and can only show analysis results, lacking interactions and the abilities for discovering the potential knowledge from big climate data. To clarify the use of the visualization techniques in climate studies, Nocke et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.17,521.66,15.02,9.96" target="#b21">[31] </ref>performed a questionnaire with climate researchers. The results showed that traditional 2D visualization techniques were the most widely used tools in climate studies, and there was a gap between climate studies and information visualization techniques. As the advance of information visualization, more climate researchers have applied the state-of-the-art visualization techniques to climate studies. Koethur et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,333.20,591.68,15.02,9.96" target="#b12">[22] </ref>combined clustering and visualization to capture the prominent spatiotemporal features from environment models. Tominski et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.99,611.66,14.97,9.96" target="#b38">[48] </ref>visualized the global climate network using information visualization techniques. Johansson et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,504.13,621.68,14.99,9.96" target="#b9">[19] </ref>used a 3D GIS platform to show the climate data. Both Yannier et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,527.25,631.64,15.02,9.96" target="#b41">[51] </ref>and Janicke et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.85,641.66,14.95,9.96" target="#b8">[18] </ref>have studied how to visualize weather variations, which are similar to our work. Their studies, however, focus on the use of touch screen in enhancing the viewer's perception, which would potentially complement our work. The most related idea was that of Drocourt et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.09,681.68,9.47,9.96">[8]</ref>, which uses a radial layout plus a map to study the changes (advance/retreat) of glaciers in Greenland. Glyphs of different shapes and colors were drawn on the sectors of a circle to represent individual changes. The visualization result, however, is a static picture without any interaction for exploring the detailed information, and the plot can <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.38,500.60,15.01,9.96" target="#b34">[44] </ref>revie of using the c oject <ref type="bibr" coords="3,189.96,520.64,15.00,9.96" target="#b13">[23] </ref>contai in climate chan ions Program in he boundaries o disciplinary char mong the public i yzed the media a omparing the n variation in the (AR4) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.71,620.60,16.60,9.96">[4] </ref>nomaly Detectio w, column, or hy mensional vector y slice from all t sed on PCA <ref type="bibr" coords="3,386.18,691.70,14.91,9.96" target="#b11">[21] </ref>he three module zation, suppleme heir own strengt ns.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">GLOBAL RADIAL MAP</head><p>We believe that full awareness, investigation, and understanding of both time and spatial patterns at the same time is extremely important, and therefore design the Global Radial Map to visualize spatiotemporal patterns in a compact view. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Map Drawing</head><p>To embed a map into a circle, the map's bounding box should fit into the circle. Using the traditional longitude/latitude equidistance grid projection, a world map could be projected onto a rectangle with the width twice of its height, which will waste much space in the circle, as shown in Our drawing method not only needs to cater for the world map, it should also be designed as generic as possible to accommodate other geographic shapes of different countries. One of the key problems is to compute the map's central coordinate. Drocourt <ref type="bibr" coords="4,253.28,525.02,10.49,9.96">[8] </ref>used a modified standard formula to compute the map gravity center of Greenland. The author, however, has not considered the scale issue and not tested his method on any map having a concave polygon contour. Inspired by GIS platforms, we use several interactive operations, such as pan, zoom-in, zoom-out, etc., to operate maps containing any countries and areas, instead of using complicated algorithms. Through these interactions, users could flexibly explore various geographical areas at any scales in an interactive manner, which is particularly useful for visualizing big data obtained from a huge amount of stations. To keep the map style intuitive and minimize the viewer's cognitive effort, we use the online tool ColorBrewer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.49,645.02,10.50,9.96">[1] </ref>to assign a color in the recommended color solution to each area. The selected color solution is also used for spatial mapping (see Section 4.2), in which stations are colored the same as the areas they belong to. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Spatial Mapping</head><p>Mapping each station with longitude, latitude and elevation 3D coordinate to a 1D angular coordinate system creates extra space that could be used to represent time and clustering information. One of the challenges in spatiotemporal mapping is to minimize the loss of spatial information when computing the angular coordinate for each station. The fact that not all the stations are on the contours of any country makes the coordinate transformation more difficult. To avoid that two geographically distant stations are arranged near each other on the ring, we use a hierarchical mapping strategy, i.e. first divide a map into several subareas and assign an angular span to each subarea in proportion to the number of the stations in that area, and then project the stations in each area onto the ring according to a reference. We use the latitude coordinate of a station as the reference (see <ref type="figure" coords="4,326.59,149.66,25.58,9.96" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4b</ref>), because climate change is sensitive to the latitude. Having obtained the angular coordinate of the first station in one area, which is equal to the area's starting angle, the angular coordinates of other stations in that area can be determined by simply adding an equal angular interval to the angular coordinate of the previous station to simplify the drawing algorithm and to maintain the symmetry of the visualization, as in <ref type="figure" coords="4,438.66,209.66,23.69,9.96" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4a</ref>. Assume P be the set of stations, L be the set of hierarchical levels, and A i be the set of subareas at the ith level.

We choose to change the map projection by selecting the Mercator projection [42] featured with shape-preserving after converting a world map to a square within a specified bounding box (longitude:-180°~180°, latitude:-85.05°~85.5°). The phenomenon of area enlargement becomes more serious as latitude increases, and the regions higher than 85.05° and lower than -85.05° cannot be mapped. Such effects on our visualizations are, however, limited due to the area-preserving feature of the Mercator projection and the fact of only one station (Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station) in such a high-latitude area. </figDesc></figure>
